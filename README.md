Trapezium Rule (MATLAB)
The trapezium rule approximates the area under a curve by dividing the interval into small segments and treating each segment as a trapezium. This method provides a straightforward approach to estimating integrals within certain limits. In operational research, the trapezium rule is often employed to approximate the integral of a function, especially when dealing with optimization problems where the objective function involves integrals.

Simpson's Rule (MATLAB)
Simpson's rule provides a more accurate approximation of the integral compared to the trapezium rule by using quadratic approximations of the curve. It divides the interval into subintervals and fits a quadratic polynomial through each pair of consecutive points. Simpson's rule is particularly useful for estimating integrals of smooth curves with a higher degree of accuracy.

Midpoint Rule (MATLAB)
The midpoint rule estimates the area under a curve by approximating it as a series of rectangles. It divides the interval into equal subintervals and computes the area of each rectangle by multiplying the function value at the midpoint of the interval by the width of the interval. The midpoint rule provides a simple approximation technique, especially when a higher degree of accuracy is not required.
